mb_sensitivity - github repo to support research on mountain

Please provide proper attribution if you use any of the data contained in this repo. 

Folders: 

model_runs: ParFlow-CLM input files and EcoSLIM input files for the six scenarios. Our research used ParFlow version 3.4.0. More information about the model runs is included in the folder.
  
outputs: selected figures and files from outputs from the six scenarios. This includes the water
  table figures and the streamflow data for each of the runs.
  
scripts: all of the R adn Matlab scripts that we developed for processing and visualizing the model data
  Figure 3 (water tables): water_table_calc.R
  Figure 4 (discharge): streamflow_analysis.R
  Figures 5, 6, 7, and 8 (flowpaths): EcoSLIM_exit_scen.R (all parts)
  Figure 9 (sensitivity plot): scatter_3d.m


Scenarios respond to each letter designation: 
A - homogeneous
